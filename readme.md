# CryptoLib

Just compile main.cs, rsa.cs and curves.cs together, including System.Numerics.dll (or use compile.bat file (it works in Windows 7 or newer)) and, you, maybe, would want to change something in Main() (main.cs).

In this code there are functions to get signatures using RSA or Elliptic Curves.

In Main() function there is Elliptic Curves signing example. 
In comments in Main() function there is RSA signing example

In both examples there is no key transfer functions, because this examples were written just to test functions, wich creates and verifies signatures.

If you've found some bugs, report them, please, and we will fix them (maybe).
